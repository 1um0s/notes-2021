# Synthesis Notes for 2021
To add your work to this repository:

* Fork the repository, and clone your forked copy.
* In your clone, add a file named `<net-id>.md` to the directory for the lecture for which you
  are adding notes. For example if your NetID is `ap191` and you are adding
  notes for the topics discussed on April 20th, you would create
  `apr20/ap191.md`. Add your notes using standard [Github
  markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to this
  file. You should make appropriate use of formatting and images. We strongly
  recommend using `template.md` as a starting point for this file.
* Once ready, commit and push to your forked copy, and then [create a pull
  request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
  back to this repository.
* Follow along as others comment on your pull request, making appropriate
  changes when necessary.
* We will merge your pull request a week or so after it is generated.
